# Raindex Strategies on Flare

## Want to earn rewards on Flare by running a Raindex strategy?

Raindex empowers you to take full control of your trading strategies. By deploying non-custodial, perpetual, and automated strategies built with **Rainlang**, you can create your own custom strategies and maintain full control of your funds.

Thanks to the **Flare Emissions Program**, you can also earn rewards while running these strategies.

**New strategies will be added weekly.**

## How to deploy:

1. **Choose and Configure Your Strategy** – Select from a variety of strategies and customize one to align with your trading approach. Every strategy you deploy is created with **Rainlang**, our open-source, DeFi-native language.
2. **Earn Rewards on Your Terms** – Once deployed, your strategy can earn rewards in rFLR tokens while running autonomously in a non-custodial vault that **you control**.

## How to earn emissions:

- **Earn points** based on your daily trading volume:
  - 1 point for $100 in volume
  - 2 points for $500 in volume
  - 3 points for $1,000 in volume
- You can **earn up to 3 points per day**.
- At the end of each epoch, points are tallied and you receive a **pro-rata share** of up to **30k rFLR per wallet**.
- **Sybil accounts are disqualified**, ensuring fairness.

Raindex and Rainlang are both **open source**—see [Github](https://github.com/rainlanguage). Code is currently un-audited so DYOR and use at your own risk.
