# Raindex Strategies on Flare

Raindex empowers you to take full control of your trading strategies. By deploying non-custodial, perpetual, and automated strategies built with **Rainlang**, you can create your own custom strategies and maintain full control of your funds.

**New strategies will be added weekly.**

## How to deploy:

Select from a variety of strategies and customize one to align with your trading approach. Every strategy you deploy is created with **Rainlang**, our open-source, DeFi-native language.

Raindex and Rainlang are both **open source**â€”see [Github](https://github.com/rainlanguage). Code is currently un-audited so DYOR and use at your own risk.
