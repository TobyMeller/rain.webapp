Raindex empowers you to take full control of your trading strategies. By deploying non-custodial, perpetual, and automated strategies built with **Rainlang**, you can create your own custom strategies and maintain full control of your funds.

**New strategies will be added weekly.**

## How to deploy

1. Choose a strategy - this page has a number of strategies that you can choose from. Choose the strategy that aligns with your convictions. Every strategy you deploy is created with **Rainlang**, our open-source, DeFi-native language.

2. Watch the videos and follow the instructions to configure and deploy the strategy.

3. Monitor the performance of the strategy, deposit and withdraw funds at any time.

Raindex and Rainlang are both **open source**â€”see [Github](https://github.com/rainlanguage). Code is currently un-audited so DYOR and use at your own risk.
